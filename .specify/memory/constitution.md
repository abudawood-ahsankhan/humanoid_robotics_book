# AI-Native Software Development: Spec-Driven Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy
All content must be verified through primary sources with peer-reviewed literature preferred. Every factual statement or concept must be linked to a verified source. Claims must be supported with citations from reliable, authoritative references.

### Clarity
Writing should be clear and precise, targeting an audience with a computer science background. Content must be structured logically with clear headings, proper grammar, and accessible language at a Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 10-12.

### Reproducibility
Any code examples, AI models, or algorithms must be traceable and replicable. All implementations must include clear instructions for reproduction, proper attribution, and version control for all materials.

### Rigor
Claims must be supported with citations; minimum 50% of sources from peer-reviewed journals. All content must meet academic standards with proper methodology, evidence-based arguments, and rigorous fact-checking processes.

### Traceable Claims
Every factual statement or concept must be linked to a source. Citation Format: APA style for all references. All sources must be verifiable and accessible to readers for validation and further research.

### Plagiarism Prevention
Zero tolerance for plagiarism; content must be original or properly paraphrased/cited. All AI-generated content (Claude Code) must be reviewed and verified against sources with proper attribution.

## Academic Standards

Content must align with Spec-Kit Plus format for modular spec-driven writing. Source Diversity: At least 15 sources, 50% peer-reviewed. Word Count: 5,000–7,000 words. Format: Deploy as a PDF with embedded citations and HTML version via GitHub Pages.

## Development Workflow

Docusaurus deployment must include navigation, search, and versioning. All AI-generated content must be reviewed and verified against sources. Visuals (diagrams, charts) must be sourced or created with proper attribution. Success Criteria: All claims verified against primary or peer-reviewed sources, Zero plagiarism detected on final manuscript, Fully functional Docusaurus site deployed to GitHub Pages, Fact-checking review passed, PDF version with embedded citations ready for submission.

## Governance

All content must follow the Spec-Driven Development methodology using Spec-Kit Plus templates. Project content must align with the defined project constitution and academic standards. All changes must be reviewed for compliance with accuracy, clarity, reproducibility, and rigor requirements.
