# Welcome to the Humanoid Robotics Book

We're excited to share our comprehensive guide to AI-native software development for robotics applications. This book represents months of work applying spec-driven development principles to create a complete humanoid robotics system using ROS 2.

## What Makes This Book Different

Unlike traditional robotics textbooks, this book takes a hands-on, specification-first approach. Every concept is demonstrated with practical examples that you can run and modify yourself. We've built a complete humanoid robot control system from the ground up, documenting every step of the process.

## Our Journey

The development of this book followed the same spec-driven methodology it teaches:

1. **Specification Phase**: We defined user stories and requirements for a complete ROS 2 robotics module
2. **Planning Phase**: We created detailed technical specifications and project structure
3. **Implementation Phase**: We built 50+ specific tasks into a working system
4. **Documentation Phase**: We created comprehensive documentation (like this website)

## What You'll Find Here

- Complete source code for a working humanoid robot system
- Step-by-step tutorials on ROS 2 concepts
- Best practices for robotics software development
- Spec-driven development methodologies applied to robotics
- Real-world examples and use cases

## Upcoming Topics

In future posts, we'll explore:

- Advanced AI integration with robotic systems
- Multi-robot coordination and communication
- Real hardware implementation tips
- Performance optimization techniques
- Safety considerations in robotics development
