# Humanoid Robotics Book: Complete Curriculum

## Welcome to Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive **Humanoid Robotics Book**, a complete educational resource covering the full stack of humanoid robot development from basic ROS 2 concepts to advanced Vision-Language-Action systems. This curriculum is designed for advanced students, AI engineers, and robotics developers with prior experience in robotics fundamentals.

## Curriculum Overview

This book is organized into four comprehensive modules that build upon each other to provide a complete understanding of humanoid robot systems:

### [Module 1: ROS 2 Robotics with Gazebo Simulation](./modules/module-1/index.md)
- Foundation in ROS 2 concepts and simulation
- Action-based control systems
- Joint control and movement planning
- Gesture recognition and execution
- Simulation environment design

### [Module 2: Isaac AI Brain for Humanoid Robots](./modules/module-2/index.md)
- Advanced perception using NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Hardware-accelerated perception pipelines
- Visual SLAM for mapping and localization
- AI training and sim-to-real transfer
- Integration with ROS 2 systems

### [Module 3: Isaac Navigation for Humanoid Robots](./modules/module-3/index.md)
- Nav2 framework configuration for humanoid robots
- Path planning and obstacle avoidance
- Bipedal locomotion control
- Environmental integration and mapping
- Autonomous navigation systems

### [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) System](./modules/module-4/index.md)
- Voice command processing with OpenAI Whisper
- LLM-based cognitive planning
- Vision grounding for action execution
- Multi-modal AI integration
- End-to-end conversational robotics
