# Module 1: ROS 2 Robotics with Gazebo Simulation

## Overview

This module introduces students to ROS 2 fundamentals through practical implementation of humanoid robot simulation in Gazebo. Students learn to develop action-based control systems, implement gesture recognition and execution, and build comprehensive simulation environments for testing robot behaviors.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will be able to:

- Install and configure ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill with Gazebo Garden
- Develop action-based movement control systems for humanoid robots
- Implement gesture recognition and execution capabilities
- Create and configure robot URDF models with joint control
- Design simulation environments for robot testing
- Integrate perception and control systems in simulation

## Key Topics

### 1. ROS 2 Fundamentals
- Installing and configuring ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill
- Understanding ROS 2 architecture (nodes, topics, services, actions)
- Working with ROS 2 workspaces and packages
- Using ROS 2 tools (rqt, rviz, ros2 cli)

### 2. Robot Control Systems
- Action-based movement control using ROS 2 actions
- Joint position control and trajectory execution
- Movement planning and execution with feedback
- Safety constraints and validation layers

### 3. Gesture Recognition and Execution
- Gesture definition and command structure
- Gesture service implementation
- Client-server communication for gesture execution
- Integration with robot control systems

### 4. Simulation Environment
- Gazebo simulation setup and configuration
- Robot model import and physics configuration
- Environment creation with obstacles and objects
- Sensor integration and perception pipeline

## Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Robot Control
- Set up ROS 2 workspace with robot control nodes
- Implement joint publisher for basic movement
- Create action server for movement commands
- Test movement execution in Gazebo simulation

### Exercise 2: Gesture System Implementation
- Design gesture command structure
- Implement gesture service server
- Create gesture client for command execution
- Test gesture execution with humanoid robot model

### Exercise 3: Advanced Movement Planning
- Implement complex movement sequences
- Add feedback and status reporting
- Create safety validation layers
- Test multi-step behaviors in simulation

## Success Criteria

- Students can successfully install and configure ROS 2 with Gazebo
- Robot responds correctly to action-based movement commands
- Gesture recognition and execution system operates reliably
- Movement planning includes proper feedback and error handling
- Simulation environment supports comprehensive testing scenarios
